## Contributing
[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/brandonarmand/binari?maxAge=25000)](https://github.com/brandonarmand/binari/issues)  
Anyone can help. We welcome first-time contributors, as well as experienced contributors.

There is plenty to do for both developers and designers of every skill level. Check out the issues, or pitch your own ideas.

### Starting points.
- New to open-source? I suggest fixing a spelling error or try doing a [first-timers-only](https://github.com/BrandonArmand/Binari/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timers-only) issue.
- Expert on all things binary tree? Try [building a lesson](https://github.com/BrandonArmand/Binari/issues/8).
- Designer? Don't be shy, we could use some work with our [designs](https://github.com/BrandonArmand/Binari/issues/7).

### Rules
1. Read the rules!
2. Issues tagged with `first-timers-only` are reserved for new contributors. Let them have a chance.
3. Each pull request should only introduce a single update at a time. Do not reference multiple issues that are unrelated to one-another.

### Setup
1) Fork the repo.
2) Run a couple of commands in the project's file directory.

```
npm install
npm start
```

3) Build.
