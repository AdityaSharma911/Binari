## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, reach out to me first. Currently the application is too early in development to split work between too many developers. Once the application is in version 0.9.0+ I will open up public issues for all to work on.

However, you are still open to fork the project and build on features you think are approriate. I will still happily consider them.

### Setup
1) Fork the repo.
2) Run a couple of commands in the project's file directory.

```
npm install
npm start
```

3) Build.
